# WELCOME

Welcome to my simple project. This project is a simple replication of the web-based instagram.

This project uses several technologies including the PHP programming language (ver 8.-), Laravel framework (ver 8.-), javascript, HTML, CSS, sql, PostgreSQL databases, Visual Studio Code, and Ubuntu OS (ver 20 .- LTS).

This project can be accessed at the following link: http://simple-ig-clone.herokuapp.com/
But for now, you only can login using existed account `deltagamma`.

There are a number of things / features that are simple and easy to implement but I am using them for the first time on this project. Personally, I feel happy to be able to implement this feature / thing. Here are some of the features / other things that have been implemented in this project:

1. Loading lazy image (first time).
2. Compress the image (the post photo feature is not on Instagram web) (the first time).
3. Auto Log In when the user closes the browser and reopens it (the first time).
4. The log-in, sign-up, timeline, and profile page views are quite similar to the original.
5. Implementation of simple SQL queries (join, select, where) to find and get data from several tables at once (the first time).
6. Validate input formats from client side and server side.
7. The use of the concept of traits / traits in laravel (first time).
